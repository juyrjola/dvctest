  notes:
    General: 'The full EFDB dataset contains 13209 entries, of which 2841 are road
      transport data: 152 fuel consumptions and 2689 emission factors. Of the emission
      factors, 202 were given per kg fuel used and 348 had units g/vehicle/d (NMVOC
      from fuel evaporation); these 550 entries were excluded. This left us with 19
      emission factors about road abrasion and tyre and break ware, and 2120 emission
      factors about tailpipe emissions, i.e. 2139 emission factors that are in this
      dataset. All are in units g/km.'
